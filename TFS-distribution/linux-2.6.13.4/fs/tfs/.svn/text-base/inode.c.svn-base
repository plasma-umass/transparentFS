 *	tfs_find_shared - find the indirect blocks for partial truncation.
 *	@inode:	  inode in question

 *	@offsets: offsets of pointers in that branch (see tfs_block_to_path)
 *	@chain:	  place to store the pointers to partial indirect blocks
 *	@top:	  place to the (detached) top of branch
 *
 *	This is a helper function used by tfs_truncate().
 *
 *	When we do truncate() we may have to clean the ends of several indirect
 *	blocks but leave the blocks themselves alive. Block is partially
 *	truncated if some data below the new i_size is refered from it (and
 *	it is on the path to the first completely truncated data block, indeed).
 *	We have to free the top of that path along with everything to the right
 *	of the path. Since no allocation past the truncation point is possible
 *	until tfs_truncate() finishes, we may safely do the latter, but top
 *	of branch may require special attention - pageout below the truncation
 *	point might try to populate it.
 *
 *	We atomically detach the top of branch from the tree, store the block
 *	number of its root in *@top, pointers to buffer_heads of partially
 *	truncated blocks - in @chain[].bh and pointers to their last elements
 *	that should not be removed - in @chain[].p. Return value is the pointer
 *	to last filled element of @chain.
 *
 *	The work left to caller to do the actual freeing of subtrees:
 *		a) free the subtree starting from *@top
 *		b) free the subtrees whose roots are stored in
 *			(@chain[i].p+1 .. end of @chain[i].bh->b_data)
 *		c) free the subtrees growing from the inode past the @chain[0].p
 *			(no partially truncated stuff there).
